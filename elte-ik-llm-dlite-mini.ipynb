Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter's colossal presence dominates the space around it. Its massive magnetic field creates a protective shield, deflecting harmful solar winds and radiation, making it a formidable guardian of the inner solar system. One of Jupiter's most iconic features is its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. This colossal tempest is larger than Earth itself, a testament to the planet's tumultuous atmosphere. Beneath its thick layer of clouds lies a world of mystery, with a core composed of metallic hydrogen and rocky material. Jupiter boasts a diverse family of moons, each with its own unique characteristics. Europa, with its icy surface and subsurface ocean, tantalizes scientists with the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, harbors its own magnetic field and may have a subsurface ocean as well.
